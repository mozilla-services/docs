============================
Run your own Sync-1.5 Server
============================

The Firefox Sync Server is deployed on our systems using RPM packaging,
and we don't provide any other packaging or publish official RPMs yet.

The easiest way to install a Sync Server is to checkout our repository
and run a build in-place. Once this is done, Sync can be run behind
any Web Server that supports the :term:`WSGI` protocol.

Important Notes
===============

These instructions are for the sync-1.5 server protocol used by the
the `new sync service <https://wiki.mozilla.org/User_Services/Sync>`_  in
Firefox 29 and later.  For a server compatible with earlier versions of
Firefox, see :ref:`howto_run_sync11`.

The new sync service uses `Firefox Accounts <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/FirefoxAccounts>`_ for user authentication, which is a separate service and is
not covered by this guide.

.. note:: By default, a server set up using this guide will defer authentication
   to the Mozilla-hosted accounts server at https://accounts.firefox.com.

You can safely use the Mozilla-hosted Firefox Accounts server in combination
with a self-hosted sync storage server.  The authentication and encryption
protocols are designed so that the account server does not know the user's
plaintext password, and therefore cannot access their stored sync data.

Alternatively, you can also :ref:`howto_run_fxa` to control all aspects of the
system.  The process for doing so is currently very experimental and not well
documented.


Prerequisites
=============

The various parts are using **Python 2.7** and **Virtualenv**. Make sure your
system has them, or install them:

- Python 2.7 downloads: http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.6
- Virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

To build and run the server, you will also need to have these packages
installed:

- python-dev
- make
- git
- c and c++ compiler

For example, under a fresh Ubuntu, you can run this command to meet all
requirements::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev git-core python-virtualenv g++


Building the server
===================

Get the latest version at https://github.com/mozilla-services/syncserver and
run the **build** command::

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla-services/syncserver
    $ cd syncserver
    $ make build

This command will create an isolated Python environment and pull all the
required dependencies in it. A **local/bin** directory is created and contains
a **gunicorn** command that can be used to run the server.

If you like, you can run the testsuite to make sure everything is working
properly::

    $ make test


Basic Configuration
===================

The server is configured using an ini-like file to specify various runtime
settings.  The file "syncserver.ini" will provide a useful starting point.

There is one setting that you *must* specify before running the server: the
client-visible URL for the service.  Open "./syncserver.ini" and locate the
following lines::

    [syncserver]
    public_url = http://localhost:5000/

The default value of "public_url" will work for testing purposes on your local
machine.  For final deployment, change it to the external, publicly-visible URL
of your server.

By default the server will use an in-memory database for storage, meaning that
any sync data will be lost on server restart.  You will almost certainly want
to configure a more permanent database, which can be done with the "sqluri"
setting::

    [syncserver]
    sqluri = sqlite:////path/to/database/file.db

This setting will accept any `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_
database URI; for example the following would connect to a mysql server::

    [syncserver]
    sqluri = pymysql://username:password@db.example.com/sync


Running the Server
==================

Now you can run the server using gunicorn and the provided "syncserver.ini"
file.  The simplest way is to use the Makefile like this::

    $ make serve

Or if you'd like to pass additional arguments to gunicorn, like this::

    $ local/bin/gunicorn --threads 4 --paste syncserver.ini

Once the server is launched, you need to tell Firefox about its location.

To configure desktop Firefox to talk to your new Sync server, go to
"about:config", search for "identity.sync.tokenserver.uri" and change its value
to the URL of your server with a path of "token/1.0/sync/1.5":

  - identity.sync.tokenserver.uri:  http://sync.example.com/token/1.0/sync/1.5

Alternatively, if you're running your own Firefox Accounts server, and running
Firefox 52 or later, see the documentation on how to :ref:`howto_run_fxa` for
how to configure your client for both Sync and Firefox Accounts with a single
preference.

Since Firefox 33, Firefox for Android has supported custom sync servers.  To
configure Android Firefox 44 and later to talk to your new Sync server, just set
the "identity.sync.tokenserver.uri" exactly as above **before signing in to
Firefox Accounts and Sync on your Android device**.

**Important**: *after* creating the Android account, changes to
"identity.sync.tokenserver.uri" will be *ignored*.  (If you need to change the
URI, delete the Android account using the *Settings > Sync > Disconnect...* menu
item, update the pref, and sign in again.)  Non-default TokenServer URLs are
displayed in the *Settings > Sync* panel in Firefox for Android, so you should
be able to verify your URL there.

Prior to Firefox 44, a custom add-on was needed to configure Firefox for
Android.  For Firefox 43 and earlier, see the blog post `How to connect Firefox
for Android to self-hosted Firefox Account and Firefox Sync servers`_.

(Prior to Firefox 42, the TokenServer preference name for Firefox Desktop was
"services.sync.tokenServerURI". While the old preference name will work in
Firefox 42 and later, the new preference is recommended as the old preference
name will be reset when the user signs out from Sync causing potential
confusion.)

Further Configuration
=====================

Once the server is running and Firefox is syncing successfully, there are
further configuration options you can tweak in the "syncserver.ini" file.

The "secret" setting is used by the server to generate cryptographically-signed
authentication tokens.  It is blank by default, which means the server will
randomly generate a new secret at startup.  For long-lived server installations
this should be set to a persistent value, generated from a good source of
randomness.  An easy way to generate such a value on posix-style systems
is to do::

    $  head -c 20 /dev/urandom | sha1sum
    db8a203aed5fe3e4594d4b75990acb76242efd35  -

Then copy-paste the value into the config file like so::

    [syncserver]
    ...other settings...
    secret = db8a203aed5fe3e4594d4b75990acb76242efd35

The "allowed_issuers" setting controls what domains can issue identity
assertions for access to the service.  By default it will accept identity
assertions from any domain.  If you are hosting your own instance of
Firefox Accounts, you may want to restrict access to just your domain::

    [browserid]
    ...other settings...
    allowed_issuers = sync.example.com

If you are using the Mozilla-hosted account server, you may want to restrict
access to just that domain like so::

    [browserid]
    ...other settings...
    allowed_issuers = api.accounts.firefox.com

The "allow_new_users" setting controls whether the server will accept
requests from previously-unseen users.  It is allowed by default, but once
you have configured Firefox and successfully synced with your user account,
additional users can be disabled by setting::

    [syncserver]
    ...other settings...
    allow_new_users = false


Updating the server
===================

You should periodically update your code to make sure you've got the latest
fixes.  The following commands will update syncserver in place::

    $ cd /path/to/syncserver
    $ git stash       # to save any local changes to the config file
    $ git pull        # to fetch latest updates from github
    $ git stash pop   # to re-apply any local changes to the config file
    $ make build      # to pull in any updated dependencies


Running behind a Web Server
===========================

The built-in server should not be used in production, as it does not really
support a lot of load.

If you want to set up a production server, you can use different web servers
that are compatible with the WSGI protocol. For example:

- *Apache* combined with *mod_wsgi*
- *NGinx* with *Gunicorn* or *uWSGI*


.. note:: Remember, you must set the **syncserver.public_url** option to the
   client-visible URL of your server.

   For example, if your server will be located at http://example.com/ff-sync/,
   the public_url should be set to this value in your config file::

       [syncserver]
       public_url = http://example.com/ff-sync/


Apache + mod_wsgi
:::::::::::::::::

Here's an example of an Apache 2.2 setup that uses mod_wsgi::

  <Directory /path/to/syncserver>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
  </Directory>

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/syncserver
    WSGIProcessGroup sync
    WSGIDaemonProcess sync user=sync group=sync processes=2 threads=25 python-path=/path/to/syncserver/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
    WSGIPassAuthorization On
    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/syncserver/syncserver.wsgi
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log combined
    ErrorLog  /var/log/apache2/example.com-error.log
  </VirtualHost>

Here's the equivalent setup for Apache 2.4, which uses a different syntax
for access control::

  <Directory /path/to/syncserver>
    Require all granted
  </Directory>

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/syncserver
    WSGIProcessGroup sync
    WSGIDaemonProcess sync user=sync group=sync processes=2 threads=25 python-path=/path/to/syncserver/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
    WSGIPassAuthorization On
    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/syncserver/syncserver.wsgi
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log combined
    ErrorLog  /var/log/apache2/example.com-error.log
  </VirtualHost>

We provide a **syncserver.wsgi** file for your convenience in the repository.
Before running Apache, edit the file and check that it loads the the right
.ini file with its full path.

Some users have reported issues with outbound TLS connections when running
under Apache.  If your server is giving 503 errors and the Apache error log
mentions "SysCallError", you may be able to correct the problem by installing
the pyopenssl library::

    $ local/bin/pip install pyopenssl


Nginx + Gunicorn
::::::::::::::::

Tested with debian stable/squeeze

1. First install gunicorn in the syncserver python environment::

    $ cd /usr/src/syncserver
    $ local/bin/pip install gunicorn

2. Then enable gunicorn in the **syncserver.ini** file::

        [server:main]
        use = egg:gunicorn
        host = 127.0.0.1
        port = 5000
        workers = 2
        timeout = 60

3. Finally edit your nginx vhost file::

        server {
                listen  443 ssl;
                server_name sync.example.com;

                ssl_certificate /path/to/your.crt;
                ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your.key;

                location / {
                        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                        proxy_redirect off;
                        proxy_read_timeout 120;
                        proxy_connect_timeout 10;
                        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
                        }
                }

5. After restarting your nginx and syncserver you should be able to use the
   sync server behind your nginx installation

.. note:: If you see errors about a mismatch between **public_url** and
   **application_url**, you may need to tell gunicorn that it should trust
   the **X-Forwarded-Proto** header being sent by nginx.  Add the following
   to the gunicorn configuration in **syncserver.ini**::

        forwarded_allow_ips = *

.. note:: If you see errors about "client sent too long header line" in your
   nginx logs, you may need to configure nginx to allow large client header
   buffers by adding this to the nginx config::

        large_client_header_buffers 4 8k;

Nginx + uWSGI
::::::::::::::::
1. Install uWSGI and its Python 2 plugin
2. Start it with the following options::

     uwsgi --plugins python27 --manage-script-name \
       --mount /<location>=/path/to/syncserver/syncserver.wsgi \
       --socket /path/to/uwsgi.sock

3. Use the following nginx configuration::

    location /<location>/ {
      include uwsgi_params;
      uwsgi_pass unix:/path/to/uwsgi.sock;
    }
