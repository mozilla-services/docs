Sync Client Documentation
=========================

This section is intended to provide a comprehensive guide to how
Firefox Sync clients interact with the server and ultimately with each
other to provide the functionality of syncing browser data between clients.

It is a somewhat technical document, but should require no in-depth
knowledge. Links to more detailed API docs offer an opportunity to dig
deeper.
