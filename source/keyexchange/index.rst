Goal of the Service
===================

Setting up a new mobile device should only involve entering a short code on the
desktop device.

Secondary request, not a hard requirement, is that if the user
has a mobile device, and is setting up a desktop device, that the flow is
similar and still involves entering the key on the desktop.

If you are using our hosted services with your own client code, 
please read the :ref:`tos`.
